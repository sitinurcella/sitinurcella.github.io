		<h2 style="color: LightSeaGreen;">Hello Everyone!</h2>
<p style="background-color: LightCoral;"> My name is Cella and i am one of the student in SMAKBO. For your information, SMAKBO stands for Sekolah Menengah Analis Kimia Bogor, and it's located at Binamarga Street. I was born in Garut, on 17<sup>th</sup> of March 2002. Therefore, my birthday is about one month again so please be prepared. My Hobby is watching movies. My kind of genre are sci-fi, thriller, action, and i also like a movie which has unpredictable plot. But i don't really into dramas because my life already is.

<p style="background-color: LightBlue;">
	Study in SMAKBO will make your head is going to explode, honestly. But i have my own way to avoid that. Such as, i like to go to the coffee shop just for calming my mind, i can be there for hours alone. The coffee shop that i usually come to is lovated in Malabar. The name of the coffee shop is Thirdwave coffee and co. I like to come there because i think the place is really calming and the beverages are pretty affordable. But if i don't have much money, i just sleep until i feel better.
